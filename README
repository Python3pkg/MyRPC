MyRPC: RPC Framework for Distributed Computing

Hi Folks,

This is my version of an RPC framework.

Features:

- No external dependencies.
- Multi-platform capability (currently only Python >= 3 server and
  JavaScript client are supported).
- IDL-based client/server stub generation.
- Binary capable (no need for escaping of binary data).
- Single roundtrip protocol, ideal for HTTP.
- Support various data types: string, binary, signed and unsigned
  integer, float, list, struct and enum.
- All data typs are supported on all platforms.
- Support exceptions.
- Correct input validation of the received messages.

(This framework heavily borrows ideas from Apache Thirft, however
it is written from scratch).
