MyRPC: RPC Framework for Distributed Computing

Hi Folks,

This is my version of an RPC framework.

Features:

 - No external dependencies.
 - Multi-platform capability (see below).
 - IDL-based client/server stub generation.
 - Binary capable (no need for escaping of binary data).
 - Single roundtrip protocol, ideal for HTTP.
 - Support various data types: string, binary, signed and unsigned
   integer, float, list, struct and enum.
 - All data typs are supported on all platforms.
 - Support exceptions.
 - Correct input validation of the received messages.
 - Legacy free code (since we are new :).

(This framework heavily borrows ideas from Apache Thrift, however
it is redesigned & rewritten from scratch).

Requirement:

 - The only requirement is a basic installation of Python >= 3.3. It
   is needed by the code generator tool (myrpcgen).

Currently, code generation is supported for the following targets:

 - Python (>= 3): only server-side stub.
 - JavaScript: only client-side stub.

Sample code: check out the examples directory.
