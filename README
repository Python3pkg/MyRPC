MyRPC: RPC Framework for Distributed Computing

Hi Folks,

This is my version of an RPC framework.

Info:

 - Feature introduction: http://myrpc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/features.html
 - Supported languages: http://myrpc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/targets.html
 - Sample code: http://myrpc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples.html
 - License: http://myrpc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/license.html
 - Full doc: http://myrpc.readthedocs.org

(This framework heavily borrows ideas from Apache Thrift, however
it is redesigned & rewritten from scratch).
