Installation
============

MyRPC source distribution consists of several components. They can
be classified into two main categories:

* myrpcgen: MyRPC code generator tool, used to compile MyRPC IDL files to
  target language dependent source code.
* Runtime libraries: they are required to compile and execute code which 
  is generated by myrpcgen.

MyRPC is highly modular, so myrpcgen and target language dependent runtime
libraries can be installed and used separately. The only constraint we have
is: myrpcgen version and runtime library versions must match. For example,
if we have some generated code which are generated with myrpcgen version 1.2.3,
then a runtime library which has the same version (1.2.3) must be used.

The latest stable release of MyRPC is 0.0.4.

.. _install-myrpcgen:

MyRPC code generator tool
-------------------------

Requirement:

* Python >= 3.3.

Source distribution can be downloaded from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/myrpcgen.

After unpacking the source distribution, change directory to
:file:`myrpcgen-x.x.x`. Here you can do system-wide installation (as
root):

.. code-block:: sh

   python setup.py install

or, as an alternative solution, myrpcgen can be installed inside the user's home
directory:

.. code-block:: sh

   python setup.py install --user

For more information about Distutils based installation, see
http://docs.python.org/3.3/install/index.html.

MyRPC code generator tool will be installed into :file:`{prefix}/bin`, be
sure to put this directory in your :envvar:`PATH`.

Python runtime
--------------

Requirement:

* Python >= 3.3.

Source distribution can be downloaded from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/myrpc-runtime.

The installation steps are similar to what is described in :ref:`install-myrpcgen`.

JavaScript runtime
------------------

Browser
^^^^^^^

Browser-side runtime source code can be downloaded directly from our repo at
https://github.com/bandipapa/MyRPC. Go to releases, and select a release
(rel-x.x.x tags) which matches your myrpcgen version. Source code is available
under :file:`runtime/js/src`. (In the future, we will prepackage browser-side
runtime sources for each release.)

Node.js
^^^^^^^

Requirements:

* Node.js >= 0.10.26.
* npm >= 1.3.11.

The installation is very simple, just enter the following command at your
project root directory:

.. code-block:: sh

   npm install myrpc-runtime

or, if you want system-wide installation, then pass *-g* to npm install. It
is also possible to install a given version, using the *@* syntax:

.. code-block:: sh

   npm install myrpc-runtime@1.2.3

Examples
--------

Requirements:

* In general, GNU Make >= 3.82 is required for building the examples.
* There can be additional, example specific dependencies, see :ref:`examples`.

Source code can be accessed at https://github.com/bandipapa/MyRPC/tree/master/examples.
