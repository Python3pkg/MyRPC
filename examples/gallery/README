MyRPC: Gallery demo

This is an example demonstrating how you can use MyRPC to create a simple
web/ajax-based picture gallery application. Try to upload an image and see
what happens... :)

Requirement (Python Package):

 - Pillow (http://python-imaging.github.io)

To start the demo:

 - cd into examples/gallery,
 - execute: "python3.3 gallery 8080" (where 8080 is a portnumber, feel
   free to use any other).

Then point your browser at http://<yourip>:8080, and upload some images. The
uploaded images are simply stored in the webserver memory.

Source code files:

 gallery                Contains a standalone webserver and the implementation of
                        GalleryService.

 gallery.idl            Interface description of GalleryService.

 GalleryService/        Generated code (stubs) for Python server-side.
                *.py

 www/                   HTML/JavaScript webcontent, served by the webserver.
     index.html
     gallery.js
     gen/               Generated code (stubs) for JavaScript client-side.
         *.js
     myrpc/             MyRPC JavaScript runtime libraries (these are just symlinks).
           *.js

To regenerate client/server stubs, first delete them (because myrpcgen won't
overwrite files), then cd into /gen, and execute:

 - Server stub: "python3.3 myrpcgen -d ../examples/gallery -g py -P ../examples/gallery/gallery.idl"
 - Client stub: "python3.3 myrpcgen -d ../examples/gallery/www/gen -g js -C ../examples/gallery/gallery.idl"
