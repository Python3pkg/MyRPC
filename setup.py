Short summary of MyRPC features:

* No external dependencies.
* Cross-platform capability.
* IDL-based client and server stub generation.
* Binary capable (no need for escaping of binary data).
* Single roundtrip protocol, ideal for HTTP (but no limited to).
* Support various data types: string, binary, signed and unsigned
  integers, floating point, list, structure and enumeration.
* All data types are supported on all platforms.
* Support exceptions.
* Correct input validation of the received messages.
* Legacy free code (since we are new :).
